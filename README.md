# autonomous-work-algorithm-string-template
Template and guidelines for the first autonomous work on algorithm string methods

## Goal
- Get familiar with string manipulation
- Get familiar with conditions
- Introduction to algorithm
- Optional : get familiar with loops

## Exercice
Create a function that detect if the word parameter is a palindrome. 
 
 > Palindrome definition: A word wich the characters read the same backward as forward. Some examples of palindromic words are redivider, deified, civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak, reviver, racecar, madam, and refer

e.g. (JavaScript) :
```javascript
function palindrome(word) {
    // your code here...
}

let test1 = palindrome("kayak");
let test2 = palindrome("canoe");

console.log(test1); // true
console.log(test2); // false
```

> Good practice: comment each line of your code to make people know you understood what you wrote
